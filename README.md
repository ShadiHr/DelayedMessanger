# Delayed Slack Messenger 

## _CPSC 210 - Personal Project_

This is a desktop application which allows users to organize and schedule 
their communications with their teams in advance and in one go.   
This application will be a great tool to those who need to routinely send out announcements or  
specific messages at specific times. In fact I was interested in developing this application because
in my previous practice I was often in charge of organizing events and coordinating my team on slack.
